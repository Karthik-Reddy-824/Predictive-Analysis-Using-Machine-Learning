This Python script analyzes Netflix genre trends from the year 2000 onward and predicts future trends for the next 5 years using Linear Regression.
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most commonly used machine learning algorithms for predicting numerical values. It is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a straight line.
Regression algorithms learn patterns from historical data by minimizing the error (difference between predicted and actual values) using techniques like least squares. The trained model then generalizes to predict outcomes for unseen data.Regression is essential for making data-driven decisions in various fields, helping businesses and researchers understand trends, relationships, and future outcomes
